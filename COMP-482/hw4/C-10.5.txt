Describe an efficient greedy algorithm for making change for a specified value
using a minimum number of coins, assuming there are four denominations of
coins (called quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies), with values 25, 10, 5, and 1,
respectively. Argue why your algorithm is correct.

Use as many quarters as possible, then as many dimes as possible, then as many nickels as possible, then as many pennies as possible.
This algorithm is correct because quarters have the highest value, followed by dimes, then nickels, then pennies.
