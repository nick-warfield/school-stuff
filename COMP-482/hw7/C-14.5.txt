Design an efficient algorithm for finding a longest directed path
from a vertex s to a vertex t of an acyclic weighted digraph G.
Specify the graph representation used and any auxiliary data structures used.
Also, analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.

probably modify depth first search somehow
