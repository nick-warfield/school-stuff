Create your own Vector class (Vector.java).
	Vector internal array is Object type (Java Object Class).
	Inside Vector class beside your own helper methods you must implement
	insertFront, insertBack, removeFront and removeBack
	with the following method signature:

		public void insertFront(Object data)
		public void insertBack(Object date)
		public Object removeFront()
		public Object removeBack()

Write your Driver (TimeVector.java) class (Class that contains main method)
	to separately time in microseconds the above vector operations for
	100, 1000, 10000 and 100000 items and print the result
	(Time it takes to perform insertion and deletion).
	Also, your program needs to print total insertion time and total deletion
	time for all the insertion and deletion scenarios.
